# Management

These scripts are for maintenance and management of existing applications.  These are handy for dealing with an application already installed on a computer and for dealing with common maintenance tasks.

For these scripts to work, they'll need to be in your `runtime` folder.  The default folder is `runtime/management` but any folder with the same relative path will work.

All project-specific configurations can go into `config.ps1`.

For bitbucket scripts, create a file `settings/bitbucket_credentials.ps` and fill out the parameters `$SECRET_username` and `$SECRET_password`.
